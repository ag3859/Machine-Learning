K means runs 5 times, for K={2,4,64,256,8}
Please note the order here. 8 is run at the end, as the values generated is taken and used in the Mog Algorithm.

By default, the full code runs on the "buildings.png" file and entire output is stored also in "output buildings.txt" file.

To run, all required to do is, torch main.lua

No further intervention will be reuqired till the end. It is however suggested that everytime a new image is re-constructed (which will happen for K=2,4,64,256,8 and for gaussian k=8), please view the image and close the same before the screen is flooded with all images and it becomes confusing.



All data was written in .txt files, and was then compiled into an excel sheet attached. These includes (for all 4 images)

->error for k means for k=2,4,8,64,256
->error for gaussian for 8 gaussians
->negative log likelihood value, calculated after k means and after gaussaian runs, for k/number of gaussians=8
->Number of bits	(Question3.1)
